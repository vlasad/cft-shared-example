### Objectives

In this module, you will learn how to:

* Discover which services are available in your deployment of Cloud Foundry
* Create a service instance using the Cloud Foundry CLI
* Bind a service instance to your application
* Access a service from your application


### Study topics

Cloud Foundry provides access to a marketplace of services, where a *service* is an instrument assuring on-demand access to *service instances*â€”reserved resources, such as databases on a dedicated or shared server or accounts in SaaS applications.
To give you an idea of how to work with services in Cloud Foundry, we are now going to create a MySQL database instance for data storage in our demo application.
