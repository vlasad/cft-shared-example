### Services

Cloud Foundry has a mechanism for providing applications with on-demand resources, such as, 
data storage on dedicated or shared servers or access to SaaS applications. 
This mechanism is often referred to as the **marketplace**. The resources consumed by applications 
inside Cloud Foundry are called **service instances**. The systems that control and deliver 
the resources are called **services**. The relationship between services and service instances can be 
compared to the relationship between an RDBMS and the databases it controls.

We will study how to work with `services` in more details later in one of next chapters.
