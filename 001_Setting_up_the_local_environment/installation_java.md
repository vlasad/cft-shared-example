### Java installation

To verify if Java is installed in local environment, in the terminal, run:

    java -version
    
The output should be similar to:

    java version "1.8.0_91"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_91-b14)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.91-b14, mixed mode)
   
If that doesn't work and Java is not installed, try following these instructions: [https://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml](https://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml)
