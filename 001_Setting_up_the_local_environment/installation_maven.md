### Maven installation

To verify if Maven is installed locally, in the terminal, run:

    mvn -version
    
The output should be similar to:

    Apache Maven 3.3.3 (7994120775791599e205a5524ec3e0dfe41d4a06; 2015-04-22T14:57:37+03:00)
    Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.3.3/libexec
    Java version: 1.8.0_25, vendor: Oracle Corporation
    Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_91.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
    Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8

If that doesn't install Maven on your machine, you can try these installation instructions: [http://maven.apache.org/install.html](http://maven.apache.org/install.html)
