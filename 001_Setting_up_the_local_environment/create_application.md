### Step 2: Creating a "HelloWorld" application

Letâ€™s build a sample single-page website:

1. Make a folder named `HelloWorld`
2. Create a file named `index.html` and add the following content to the file:

        <html>
            <body>
                Hello World!
            </body>
        </html>
