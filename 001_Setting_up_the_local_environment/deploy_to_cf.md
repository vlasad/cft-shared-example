### Step 3: Deploying an application to Cloud Foundry

Use the Cloud Foundry CLI to run the `cf push` command and deploy your app. 
For details, see the "Installing the Cloud Foundry CLI" section in one of the previous modules. 
As soon as the `push` command has been issued, Cloud Foundry performs the following actions to make the application available:

1. Uploads and saves app files
2. Verifies and saves app metadata
3. Creates a “droplet” (the Cloud Foundry unit of execution) for the app
4. Selects an appropriate Diego cell or Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) to run the droplet
5. Starts the app

To push the demo application to Cloud Foundry, use the `cf push` command (for more information about deployment options, see other training modules):

        cf push helloworld -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git

The output will be similar to this:

        Updating app helloworld in org org / space demo as user...
        OK

        Uploading helloworld...
        Uploading app files from: /Users/user/Documents/helloworld

It possible that selected name `helloworld` is already reserved for another applications, and in this case you will see following error message:

    Creating route helloworld.[cloud-foundry].com...
    OK
    
    FAILED
    Server error, status code: 400, error code: 210003, message: The host is taken: helloworld
    
That happens because the route should be unique per Cloud Foundry instance, just try to deploy your application using any other name. 

In order to get an access to the log messages stream generated by application you can use "cf logs APP_NAME --recent" command. For example:

    cf logs helloworld --recent
    
In an output for this commnad you will see messages related to Spring Boot initialization:
