As part of its design, Cloud Foundry is really easy to use for developers. Deploying applications in different 
programming languages is a breeze, and binding those applications to external services, such as databases, message 
queues, or third-party APIs, is also really simple and straightforward.

Before we start, let's install some prerequisite tools that we will need later in the course and then proceed with deploying our first 
“HelloWorld” application to Cloud Foundry. 

In this module, you will learn how to:

* Set up a local environment for working with Cloud Foundry
* Verify that your system has all the prerequisites installed
* Log into Cloud Foundry using the cf cli
* Deploy a demo application to Cloud Foundry
* Check that your application is working
* Fix some common issues with the Cloud Foundry CLI
