### Step 1: Managing routes via the CLI

As we have said, every Cloud Foundry app is mapped to an IP address (aka a route), which is then used by the Cloud Foundry router to route requests. Associating apps with routes is called mapping.

To load the list of existing routes, run:
	
	cf routes
	
You will see output similar to this:

	space   host               domain                     port   path   type   apps                           service
	demo    helloworld         [cloud-foundry].com                             helloworld
	

The route from this example was automatically generated by `cf push`. The URL is composed of the host and domain names of the corresponding Cloud Foundry application: `http://HOST.DOMAIN`. In our example, all requests addressed to `HelloWorld` will be sent to the URL `http://helloworld.[cloud-foundry-instance].com`. The host name is usually identical to the application name, but you can modify it by editing the `host` property in `manifest.yml`.

	---
	applications:
	- name: helloworld
	  host: demo
	  memory: 256mb
	  instances: 1
	  path: target/helloworld-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git

Now you can run:

	cf push
	cf apps 

The output will show that a second route to the application was added, making it available at the following URLs: 

	name         requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
    helloworld   started           1/1         256M     1G     helloworld.[cloud-foundry].com, demo.[cloud-foundry].com
